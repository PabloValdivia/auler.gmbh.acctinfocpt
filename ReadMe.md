#Description
This plugin provides a custom form to display some special accounting information.
My decision was to create a custom form to have the full control over the functionality
and to extend the functionality step by step.
 
  
##AccountCourse
Shows the current balance up to date at this line for the defined Account in the
defined date range. The beginning balance is on the first line showed. The 
ending balance is on the last Account posting line.


##Summary
Shows the balance per year, month or day.

## Accountsoverview
Displays a overview to all accounts from the COA with the current balance.
A date range can be defined in different kinds.
1. DateFrom empty and only DateTo is filled.
2. DateFrom and DateTo are inserted.
Accountvalues are not needed.
*Is time critical if there are many data* 

## Accountoverview
Displays a overview to the defined account with the current balance.
A date range can be defined in different kinds.
1. DateFrom empty and only DateTo is filled.
2. DateFrom and DateTo are inserted.



##SummaryAccountDocument
In the most cases each product generate a separate factline. If you
have 100 positions in your invoice as example, then the view of the 
accounting for a document can be a little bit confusing. This view 
show the posting as summary per account.



## Installation

In the sql-folder are two files to install in the db.

1. pat_facource.sql -> Is the needed View.
2. pat_accountcourse.sql -> The function for AccountCourse
